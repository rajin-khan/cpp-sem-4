usually, every oop problem has

one driver file for decalrations, (.h) //here, remember to make default constructors, parameterized constructors, and desctructors.
one .cpp file for definition (.cpp)
one driver file (main.cpp)

use PascalCaseConvention for na,ing classes in cpp.

for default constructors in cpp, no need to give parenthesis, so a1 is fine instead of a1();

you take string input with:
getline (cin, variablename);

although usually, before using getline, use cin.ignore() if you've used the input stream (cin) to take an integer or any other input before using getline.

runtime can be made shorter with: 
ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
cin.tie(NULL);
