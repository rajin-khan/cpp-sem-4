usually, every oop problem has

one driver file for decalrations, (.h) //here, remember to make default constructors, parameterized constructors, and desctructors.
one .cpp file for definition (.cpp)
one driver file (main.cpp)

use PascalCaseConvention for na,ing classes in cpp.

for default constructors in cpp, no need to give parenthesis, so a1 is fine instead of a1();

you take string input with:
getline (cin, variablename);
